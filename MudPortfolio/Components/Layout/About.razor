  <MudText Class="d-flex d-md-none">Hey there! I'm Jon, and I'm passionate about creating digital experiences. I first
    dipped into web development in 2021 while
    building a site for my pop-up business. That hands-on experience not only got me hooked but also gave me a solid
    foundation in web
    and app development.</MudText>
  <MudText Class="d-flex d-md-none">Fast-forward to today, Iâ€™m a software engineer at Raven Solutions, and I develop
    accessible digital solutions
    using modern C# and Blazor stacks. My work spans responsive MudBlazor interfaces, SQL/Entity Framework data
    architectures, and AWS cloud integrationsâ€”blending technical precision with purposeful design.</MudText>
           <MudText Class="d-flex d-md-none">When Iâ€™m not coding or debugging, youâ€™ll find me enjoying the little thingsâ€”whether 
          itâ€™s hiking scenic trails with my family, biking through the neighborhood, or getting my hands dirty in the garden. 
          Off the clock, I recharge by baking sourdough bread, trail running, and drinking local
           craft beer.</MudText>
